### 5. Additional User Management Commands
1. View all users in the system:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/passwd
   ```
2. Create a user with a home directory:

   sudo useradd -m username
   ```
3. Create a user with a specific shell:
   ```bash
   sudo useradd -s /bin/bash username
   ```
4. Lock and unlock user accounts:
   ```bash
   # Lock a user account
   sudo passwd -l username

   # Unlock a user account
   sudo passwd -u username
   ```

## Conclusion
In this lab, you practiced:
1. Adding new user accounts using `useradd`.
2. Setting and updating passwords with `passwd`.
3. Modifying user details using `usermod`.
4. Deleting user accounts using `userdel`.

These commands are essential for managing users and performing system administration tasks in Linux environments.
