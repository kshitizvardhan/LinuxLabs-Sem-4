# Lab 15 & 16

---

## Experiment Description
This lab focuses on writing shell scripts to print system information, perform basic mathematical calculations, and use redirection operators to store command outputs.

---

## Approach

### 1. Writing a Shell Script to Print System Information
A shell script can be used to display system details such as hostname, uptime, disk usage, and memory status.

#### Script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "System Information:"
echo "--------------------"
echo "Hostname: $(hostname)"
echo "Uptime: $(uptime -p)"
echo "Disk Usage:"
df -h
echo "Memory Usage:"
free -m
```

#### Execution:
```bash
./system_info.sh
```

### 2. Writing a Shell Script for Basic Mathematical Calculations
A shell script can perform arithmetic operations using the `expr` or `bc` command.

#### Script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter two numbers:"
read a b
echo "Sum: $(expr $a + $b)"
echo "Difference: $(expr $a - $b)"
echo "Product: $(expr $a \* $b)"
echo "Quotient: $(expr $a / $b)"
```

#### Execution:
```bash
./math_calc.sh
```

### 3. Using Redirection Operators to Store Command Output
Redirection operators (`>`, `>>`) are used to save the output of commands into a file.

#### Example:
```bash
./system_info.sh > system_report.txt
./math_calc.sh >> calculations.txt
```
- `>` overwrites the file.
- `>>` appends to the file.

To view stored output:
```bash
cat system_report.txt
cat calculations.txt
```

## Conclusion
This lab demonstrated how to:
- Write shell scripts to print system details.
- Perform basic arithmetic operations using shell scripting.
- Use redirection operators to save command output to a file.

These concepts are essential for automation and efficient command-line operations in Linux.
